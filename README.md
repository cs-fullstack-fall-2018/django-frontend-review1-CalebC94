# django-frontend-review1

You asked a magic mirror who has the prettiest app of the land and they didn't say your Memphis Non-Profit App. Create a base.html app to create a template for it, and use bootstrap to add an image and styling to your app. Make sure to include a container and jumbotron for the base.html and make your entries into cards on the page. Make sure to include a new, small about page about the developer.
